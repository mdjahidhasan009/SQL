# SQL View
A view is a virtual table whose contents are obtained from an existing table or tables, called base tables. The retrieval
happens through an SQL statement, incorporated into the view. So, you can think of a view object as a view into the base
table. The view itself does not contain an real data, the data is electronically stored in the base table. The view
simply shows the data contained in the base table.
