## Single-line comments
Single line comments are preceded by --, and go until the end of the line:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees -- this is a comment
WHERE FName = 'John'
```

## Multi-line comments
Multi-line code comments are wrapped in /* ... */:
```sql
/* This query
    returns all employees */
SELECT *
FROM Employees
```
It is also possible to insert such a comment into the middle of a line:
```sql
SELECT /* all columns: */ *
FROM Employees
```
