## `stuff()` function
The stuff function deletes a part of the string and then inserts another part into the string starting at a specified 
position.

`STUFF(String1, Position, Length, String2)`

## Union
The Union operator is used to combine the result set of two or more select statements. For example, the first select 
statement returns the fish shown in Image A, and the second returns the fish shown in Image B. Then, the Union operator 
will return the result of the two select statements as shown in Image A U B. Also, if there is a record present in both 
tables, then we will get only one of them in the final result.

## Intersect
The Intersect operator helps combine two select statements and returns only those records that are common to both the 
select statements. So, after we get Table A and Table B over here and if we apply the Intersect operator on these two 
tables, then we will get only those records that are common to the result of the select statements of these two.
