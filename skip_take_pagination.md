## Limiting amount of results
ISO/ANSI SQL:
``sql
SELECT * FROM TableName FETCH FIRST 20 ROWS ONLY;
``
MySQL; PostgreSQL; SQLite:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TableName LIMIT 20;
```
Oracle:
```sql
SELECT Id,
    Col1
FROM (SELECT Id,
        Col1,
        row_number() over (order by Id) RowNumber
      FROM TableName)
WHERE RowNumber <= 20
```
SQL Server:
```sql
SELECT TOP 20 *
FROM dbo.[Sale]
```

## Skipping then taking some results (Pagination)
ISO/ANSI SQL:
```sql
SELECT Id, Col1
FROM TableName
ORDER BY Id
OFFSET 20 ROWS FETCH NEXT 20 ROWS ONLY;
```
MySQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TableName LIMIT 20, 20; -- offset, limit
```
Oracle; SQL Server:
```sql
SELECT Id,
    Col1
  FROM (SELECT Id,
           Col1,
           row_number() over (order by Id) RowNumber
       FROM TableName)
WHERE RowNumber BETWEEN 21 AND 40
```
PostgreSQL; SQLite:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TableName LIMIT 20 OFFSET 20;
```

## Skipping some rows from result
ISO/ANSI SQL:
```sql
SELECT Id, Col1
FROM TableName
ORDER BY Id
OFFSET 20 ROWS
```
MySQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TableName LIMIT 20, 42424242424242;
-- skips 20 for take use very large number that is more than rows in table
```
Oracle:
```sql
SELECT Id,
    Col1
FROM (SELECT Id,
            Col1,
            row_number() over (order by Id) RowNumber
      FROM TableName)
WHERE RowNumber > 20
```
PostgreSQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TableName OFFSET 20;
```
SQLite:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TableName LIMIT -1 OFFSET 20;
```
