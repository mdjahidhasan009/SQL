## Create Sequence
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE orders_seq
START WITH 1000
INCREMENT BY 1;
```
Creates a sequence with a starting value of 1000 which is incremented by 1.

## Using Sequences
a reference to seq_name.NEXTVAL is used to get the next value in a sequence. A single statement can only generate
a single sequence value. If there are multiple references to NEXTVAL in a statement, they use will use the same
generated number.

NEXTVAL can be used for INSERTS
```sql
INSERT INTO Orders (Order_UID, Customer)
VALUES (orders_seq.NEXTVAL, 1032);
```
It can be used for UPDATES
```sql
UPDATE Orders
SET Order_UID = orders_seq.NEXTVAL
WHERE Customer = 581;
```
It can also be used for SELECTS
```sql
SELECT Order_seq.NEXTVAL FROM dual;
```
