## Simple views
A view can ﬁlter some rows from the base table or project only some columns from it:

```sql
CREATE VIEW new_employees_details AS
SELECT E.id, Fname, Salary, Hire_date
FROM Employees E
WHERE hire_date > date '2015-01-01';
```
If you select form the view:
```sql
select * from new_employees_details
```
| Id  | FName       | Salary | Hire_date    |
|-----|-------------|--------|--------------|
| 4   | Johnathon   | 500    | 24-07-2016   |

## Complex views
A view can be a really complex query(aggregations, joins, subqueries, etc). Just be sure you add column names for
everything you select:

```sql
Create VIEW dept_income AS
SELECT d.Name as DepartmentName, sum(e.salary) as TotalSalary
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d on e.DepartmentId = d.id
GROUP BY d.Name;
```
Now you can select from it as from any table:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM dept_income;
```

| DepartmentName | TotalSalary |
|----------------|-------------|
| HR             | 1900        |
| Sales          | 600         |
