A materialized view is a view whose results are physically stored and must be periodically refreshed in order to
remain current. They are therefore useful for storing the results of complex, long-running queries when realtime
results are not required. Materialized views can be created in Oracle and PostgreSQL. Other database systems oï¬€er
similar functionality, such as SQL Server's indexed views or DB2's materialized query tables.

## PostgreSQL example
```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable (number INT);
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (1);
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myview AS SELECT * FROM mytable;
SELECT * FROM myview;
```
Output
```
number
--------
1
(1 row)
```

```sql
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES(2);
SELECT * FROM myview;
```
Output
```
number
--------
1
(1 row)
```

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW myview;
SELECT * FROM myview;
```
Output
```
number
--------
1
2
(2 rows)
```
