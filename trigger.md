# Trigger
Trigger allows us to execute a batch of SQL code when a table event occurs(Insert, update or delete command executed
against a specific table)

## Nested Triggers
Triggers may implement data modification logic by using INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement. These triggers that contain
data modification logic and find other triggers for data modification are called Nested Triggers.
