# One-to-One Relationship
One-to-One relationship can be implemented as a single table and rarely as two tables with primary key and foreign key
relationships.

# One-to-Many relationship
One-to-Many relationships are implemented by splitting the data into two tables with primary key and foreign key 
relationships. 

# Many-to-Many relationship
Many-to-Many relationships are implemented using a junction table with the keys from both tables forming the composite
primary key of the junction table.
