## Logical Order of Query Processing in SQL

Understanding the logical processing order of SQL queries helps in designing and optimizing queries effectively.

```sql
/*(8)*/ SELECT /*9*/ DISTINCT /*11*/ TOP
/*(1)*/ FROM
/*(3)*/ JOIN
/*(2)*/ ON
/*(4)*/ WHERE
/*(5)*/ GROUP BY
/*(6)*/ WITH {CUBE | ROLLUP}
/*(7)*/ HAVING
/*(10)*/ ORDER BY
/*(11)*/ LIMIT
```

### Description of Each Step:

The order in which a query is processed and the description of each section:

1. **FROM**: A Cartesian product (cross join) is performed between the first two tables in the FROM clause, resulting in virtual table VT1.
2. **ON**: The ON filter is applied to VT1, generating VT2 by retaining only rows where the condition is TRUE.
3. **JOIN**: If an OUTER JOIN is specified, unmatched rows are added to VT2, creating VT3. This step repeats for each additional table.
4. **WHERE**: The WHERE filter is applied to VT3, generating VT4 by including only rows where the condition is TRUE.
5. **GROUP BY**: Rows in VT4 are grouped based on specified columns, forming VT5.
6. **CUBE | ROLLUP**: Supergroups are added to VT5, resulting in VT6.
7. **HAVING**: The HAVING filter is applied to VT6, creating VT7 by retaining groups that meet the condition.
8. **SELECT**: Columns specified in the SELECT clause are processed, generating VT8.
9. **DISTINCT**: Duplicate rows are removed from VT8, forming VT9.
10. **ORDER BY**: Rows in VT9 are sorted as per the ORDER BY clause, producing VC10 (virtual cursor).
11. **TOP | LIMIT**: A specified number of rows are selected from the beginning of VC10, generating the final result VT11.

### Example Tables Creation and Data Insertion:

#### Creating Example Tables

```sql
-- Creating Employees table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FName VARCHAR(50),
    LName VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Hire_date DATE,
    DepartmentId INT
);

-- Creating Departments table
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

#### Inserting Data

```sql
-- Inserting data into Employees table
INSERT INTO Employees (Id, FName, LName, Salary, Hire_date, DepartmentId) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 50000, '2017-06-01', 1),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 60000, '2018-07-15', 2),
(3, 'Jim', 'Brown', 70000, '2019-08-20', 1);

-- Inserting data into Departments table
INSERT INTO Departments (Id, Name) VALUES
(1, 'HR'),
(2, 'Finance');
```

### Sample Query Demonstrating Logical Order:

```sql
SELECT d.Name AS DepartmentName, COUNT(e.Id) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE e.Salary > 50000
GROUP BY d.Name
HAVING COUNT(e.Id) > 1
ORDER BY EmployeeCount DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation of the Example Query Processing:

1. **FROM**: Creates VT1 by joining Employees and Departments.
2. **ON**: Filters rows based on DepartmentId, generating VT2.
3. **WHERE**: Filters employees with a salary greater than 50,000, creating VT3.
4. **GROUP BY**: Groups data by department names, forming VT5.
5. **HAVING**: Retains groups with more than one employee, producing VT7.
6. **SELECT**: Extracts columns, generating VT8.
7. **ORDER BY**: Sorts results by EmployeeCount, creating VC10.
8. **LIMIT**: Selects the top result.
