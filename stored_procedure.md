# Stored Procedure
A Stored Procedure is a function which consists of many SQL statements to access the database system. Several SQL 
statements are consolidated into a stored procedure and execute them whenever and wherever required which saves time and
avoid writing code again and again.

A stored procedure can be used as a means of modular programming, i.e., we can create a stored procedure once, store it,
and call it multiple times as required. This also supports faster execution when compared to executing multiple queries.
